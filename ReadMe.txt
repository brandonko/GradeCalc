GradeCalc Chrome Extension 
Created by Brandon Ko

I created this extension to provide more in-depth statistics on grades as well as
calculate the minimum score on future assignments to maintain a specific grade.
This is made for UW students who have grades canvas.uw.edu.

-Version 1.1-
Working weighted and unweighted grade calculator. Still need to provide the table
with editing option to edit each individual score per category (increase customizability).
