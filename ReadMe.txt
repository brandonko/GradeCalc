GradeCalc Chrome Extension 
Created by Brandon Ko
17 June 2018

I created this extension to provide more in-depth statistics on grades as well as
calculate the minimum score on future assignments to maintain a specific grade.
This is made for UW students who have grades canvas.uw.edu.

-Version 1.0-
Weighted calculation almost fully functional.

-Version 1.1-
Working weighted and unweighted grade calculator. Still need to provide the table
with editing option to edit each individual score per category (increase customizability).

-Version 1.2-
Added reset button to clear data after selecting "Weighted" or "Unweighted". Changed "Make an Edit" to edit the Grade Categories table by category instead of adjusting the total acquired points directly. More specific, and makes weighted calculations possible after edits. Added categories to minimum score, allowing weighted calculations to work for minimum score as well.

-Version 1.3-
Replaced all bullet lists <radio> with dropdown menus <option> for ease of use (also takes up less space on the extension popup).
